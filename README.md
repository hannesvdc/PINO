# PINO - Physics-Informed Neural Operators
Conclusion after months of trying to train a physics-informed neural operator: they are not worth it. PINNs may work in theory and in small test cases, but they are a nightmare to train and yield poorer results than standard PDE solver for 100000x the resources.
